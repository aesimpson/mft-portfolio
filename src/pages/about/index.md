I'm a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist with a Masters degree in Counseling Psychology working with children, pre-teens, teens, and adults. My therapeutic approach is person-centered meaning I meet clients where they are and empower them to change or improve behavior. Through my authentic, positive energy and interactive approach, I provide clients with tools to help them live their best lives and build overall self-esteem and confidence. Also, as a Multiracial woman, I understand people through multiple perspectives as that has been my experience navigating the world. Based on my personal experience as well as my work with children and adolescents from various backgrounds, I have a unique understanding of race, mental health and community needs.

My counseling experience includes working with clients from various settings and diverse populations such as a non-profit organization working with children and their families living in poverty and trauma providing mental health therapy services in their schools, a residential treatment facility, counseling center supporting adults who are mandated to receive therapy services to reintegrate them back into family life, medical offices providing support and care to patients living with chronic illnesses, therapeutic camps for children as well as therapeutic expressive art programs.
